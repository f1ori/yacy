YaCy lng highlighting for Notepad++

To enable the highlighting of YaCy lng files simply copy the file userDefineLang.xml into your %APPDATA%\Notepad++ directory.
If you installed Notepad++ with the "Dont use %APPDATA%" option copy the file directly into the Notepad++ root directory.

If you have already created other user defined languages merge the content of your existing userDefineLang.xml with the contents of ours.

Now open one of the lng files and highlighting should work instantly. "YaCy lng" is now available in the "Language"-menue, too.
