<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
	YaCy-UI is going to be a JavaScript based client for YaCy based on the existing XML and JSON API. 
	YaCy-UI is at most alpha status, as there is still problems with retriving the search results.
	I am currently changing the backend to a more application friendly format and getting good results with it (I will check that in some time after the stable release 0.7).
	For now have a look at the bookmarks, performance has increased significantly, due to the use of JSON and Flexigrid!

		<li>29-09-2008: There seems to be timing problems with the RSS search result. In some cases no result is shown at all, even after a page reload!</li>
		<li>29-09-2008: <strike>Bookmarks may crash if you create folders like /news and /newspaper with the same beginning! This is a bug in the folder recursion!</strike></li>
		<li>15-09-2008: <strike>there seems to be a bug with the German translation: the link yacyui-bookmarks.html gets translated into yacyui-Lesezeichen.html :-(</strike></li> 
		<li>12-05-2008: <strike>if you click a tag in the tagcloud, the bookmarks table doesn't update properly and JavaScript returns a 'tabs is undefined' error...</strike></li>
		<li>10-05-2008: <strike>there is an issue with Firefox 3.0b5 and the jQuery XML parsing of the search result (one symptom is the broken pagination)</strike></li>
		<li>19-04-2008: <strike>if you open more than one search tab in Firefox 2.x or Safari, only the first result item is shown. I would be greatful for any hint...</strike></li>
		<li>19-04-2008: <strike>resource types 'sciencenet' and 'bookmarks' doen't work yet. For 'sciencenet' we have to solve the Ajax cross domain restriction.</strike></li>
