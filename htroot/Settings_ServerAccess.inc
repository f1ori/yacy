    <td><strong>Here you can restrict access to the server.</strong>  By default, the access is not limited,
           because this function is needed to spawn the p2p index-sharing function.
           If you block access to your server (setting anything else than '*'), then you will also be blocked
           from using other peers' indexes for search service.
           However, blocking access may be correct in enterprise environments where you only want to index your
           company's own web pages.</td>

           peer is behind a firewall or proxy.</strong> You can create a tunnel through the firewall/proxy
           (look out for 'tunneling through https proxy with connect command') and create
           an access point for incoming connections.
           This access address can be set here (either as IP number or domain name).
           If the address of outgoing connections is equal to the address of incoming connections,
           you don't need to set anything here, please leave it blank.<br />
           ATTENTION: Your current IP is recognized as "#[clientIP]#".
           If the value you enter here does not match with this IP,
           you will not be able to access the server pages anymore.</td>
